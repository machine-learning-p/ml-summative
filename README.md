# UEMOA Bank Financial Health Prediction

## Mission & Problem Description

This project aims to enhance financial stability within the West African Economic and Monetary Union (UEMOA). I have built a machine learning model to predict a bank's financial distress risk by forecasting its Z-score. This provides an early warning system for regulators 
to identify and support at-risk institutions, thereby strengthening the region's banking sector.
